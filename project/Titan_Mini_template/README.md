**English** | [**中文**](README_zh.md)

## Introduction

This is a template project for **Titan Board Mini**. It implements basic LED blinking functionality and can be used as a starting point for secondary development.

## Features

This template provides:
- RT-Thread full system configuration
- Basic LED driver (GPIO)
- Serial debug output (UART)
- Project structure for secondary development
