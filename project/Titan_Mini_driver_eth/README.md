# Ethernet Example Guide

[**Chinese**](README_zh.md) | **English**

## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to use the **Ethernet interface** on **Titan Board Mini**, combined with the **RT-Thread Ethernet driver framework** to implement network communication functions.

Key features include:

- Initialize RA8 series Ethernet hardware
- Configure IP address, subnet mask, and gateway
- Send and receive Ethernet frames
- Integrate RT-Thread `netdev` framework for unified network device management
- Support DMA and interrupts for high-speed data transfer

## Ethernet Overview

### 1. General Introduction

**Ethernet** is the most widely used Local Area Network (LAN) technology, proposed by Xerox PARC in the 1970s and later standardized by IEEE 802.3. Ethernet has the following characteristics:

- **Data transmission method**: Frame-based packet switching, physically transmitted through twisted pair, fiber optic, or wireless media.
- **Topology**: Traditional Ethernet used bus or star topology, while modern Ethernet mainly adopts star and tree topologies.
- **Protocol layer**: Belongs to the data link layer (Layer 2) and physical layer (Layer 1) technologies of the OSI model.

### 2. Ethernet Frame Structure

Ethernet uses **frames** as the unit of data transmission. An Ethernet frame consists of the following fields:

| Field                     | Length          | Description                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Preamble                  | 7 bytes         | Used for frame synchronization                 |
| Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) | 1 byte        | Frame start marker, value is 10101011          |
| Destination MAC Address   | 6 bytes         | Receiver hardware address                      |
| Source MAC Address        | 6 bytes         | Transmitter hardware address                   |
| Type/Length               | 2 bytes         | Upper layer protocol type or frame length      |
| Data Payload              | 46~1500 bytes   | Upper layer data (e.g., IP packet)             |
| CRC Checksum              | 4 bytes         | Cyclic redundancy check for frame integrity    |

> **Minimum frame length**: 64 bytes
> **Maximum frame length**: 1518 bytes (without VLAN tag)

## RA8 Series Ethernet Features

RA8 series MCUs (such as RA8P1) integrate high-performance **Ethernet MAC**, supporting RGMII, RMII, and MII interfaces, providing stable and reliable high-speed network communication capabilities. The MAC can work with external PHY and is compatible with the LwIP TCP/IP protocol stack.

## Build & Download

* RT-Thread Studio: Download the Titan Board resource package from the package manager in RT-Thread Studio, then create a new project and build it.


After compilation is complete, connect the development board's USB-DBG interface to the PC, then download the firmware to the development board.

## Running Effect

Insert the network cable into the Ethernet port, press the reset button to restart the development board. After waiting for PHY0 link up, enter `ifconfig` to view the IP address obtained by the development board, then enter `ping baidu.com` command for connectivity testing.
